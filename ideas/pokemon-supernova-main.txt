Pokémon Supernova:

You are a boy that wakes up in the middle of a garbage dump. You don't remember anything, and are on a quest to get back your memories. To do so, you must beat 16 Gym Leaders, 8 Gym Masters, the Elite 4, and the Champion himself. This grants you access to the Hall of Fame, where only the Champion can view the records and memories for all the trainers in the region. Along the way, you catch and train Pokémon to aid you on your journey.

Garbage Dump:
The starting area. You will wake up somewhere here, with no memories, and try to find your way out of this mini-maze. At the end, you befriend a Pokémon from these choices: Magby, Elekid, Rhyhorn, Smoochum, Horsea, Togepi, Budew, Porygon, Pawniard, Duskull
